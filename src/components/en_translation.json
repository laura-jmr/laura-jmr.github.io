The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input, disclosure, safeguarding availability and separation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account during the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings. Shortening of the IP address: If IP addresses are processed by us or by the service providers and technologies used and the processing of a full IP address is not required, the IP address is shortened (also known as 'IP masking'). The last two digits or the last part of the IP address after a dot are removed or replaced by placeholders. The purpose of shortening the IP address is to prevent or make it much more difficult to identify a person by their IP address. TLS/SSL encryption (https): To protect user data transmitted via our online services, we use TLS/SSL encryption. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard technology for securing internet connections by encrypting the data transmitted between a website or app and a browser (or between two servers).

This information may include, for example, content viewed, websites visited, online networks used, but also communication partners and technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times and functions used. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this can also be processed. The IP addresses of users are also stored. However, we use available IP masking procedures (i.e. pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, no clear user data is stored as part of the online marketing process (such as e-mail addresses or names) are stored, but pseudonyms. This means that we and the providers of the online marketing processes do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles. The information in the profiles is generally stored in cookies or by means of similar procedures. These cookies can generally also be read later on other websites that use the same online marketing process and analyzed for the purpose of displaying content as well as supplemented with further data and stored on the server of the online marketing process provider. In exceptional cases, clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case, for example, if the users are members of a social network whose online marketing process we use and the network links the user profiles with the aforementioned data. Please note that users can make additional agreements with the providers, e.g. by giving their consent during registration. In principle, we only receive access to summarized information about the success of our advertisements. However, as part of so-called conversion measurements, we can check which of our online marketing processes have led to a so-called conversion, i.e., for example, to the conclusion of a contract with us. Conversion measurement is used solely to analyze the success of our marketing measures. Unless otherwise stated, we ask you to assume that the cookies used are stored for a period of two years.",

Furthermore, user data is generally processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created based on user behavior and the resulting interests of users. The user profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are generally stored on the user's computer, in which the user's usage behavior and interests are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them). For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the opt-out options, please refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective networks. In the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we would also like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the users' data and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.",

The font provider is informed of the user's IP address so that the fonts can be made available in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) is transmitted that is necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical environment. This data can be processed on a server of the font provider in the USA - When visiting our online offering, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e. a software interface for retrieving the fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides users with the Google Fonts Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and then the fonts specified in the CCS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the respective user to access the Internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent, which describes the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referral URL (i.e. the web page on which the Google Font is to be displayed). IP addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers and are not analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent and referral URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for which the user wants to load fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font family is requested. With the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent needs to customize the font that is generated for each browser type. The user agent is primarily logged for debugging and used to generate aggregated usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregate usage statistics are published on the Google Fonts Analytics page. Finally, the referral URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and an aggregated report on the top integrations based on the number of font requests can be generated. Google says it does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to create end-user profiles or serve targeted ads; Service provider: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR); Website: ",
